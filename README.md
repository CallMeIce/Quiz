# Quiz

# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

My motivation for this project was to make a quiz to see if some people know anything about the company Pontiac and just to test there knowledge. I built this to make a fun interactive way to people test there knowledge on Pontiac. I learned on how to Pseudo Code through my project and become a bit more comfortable using javascript.
